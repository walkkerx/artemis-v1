                Inspired by Oxford&rsquo;s collegiate system and Minerva&rsquo;s global rotation, Artemis
                hostels are residential communities with their own culture, traditions, and identity.
                Each one is a world unto itself — common rooms where debates run past midnight,
                shared kitchens where five cuisines cook simultaneously, and gardens where you can
                think in peace.
              </p>
              <p className="text-[16px] text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                You don&rsquo;t just live in a hostel — you belong to it. And when you rotate to the next
                city, you carry that belonging with you. The hostel you leave behind stays in your
                story forever; the one you arrive at becomes home within days.
              </p>
              <p className="text-[16px] text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                From the Aurora Lodge in Reykjavik to the Southern Cross in Sydney, every hostel
                has its own character — but they all share the same heartbeat: the conviction that
                how you live matters as much as what you learn.

                In the Oxford tradition, every college has its rituals. At Artemis, those rituals
                don&rsquo;t belong to a building — they belong to the community. Wherever students rotate,
                the traditions travel with them, creating continuity across continents and turning
                every new city into home by the end of the first week.

                From the Crossing to the Common Table, these practices bind the network together
                — not through uniformity, but through a shared commitment to presence, reflection,
                and the belief that how you live matters as much as what you learn.
