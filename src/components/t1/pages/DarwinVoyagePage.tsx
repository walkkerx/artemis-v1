            Step into a virtual time capsule to discover how Artemis replaced the campus with the planet itself. The Voyage Rotation — a five-leg global circumnavigation born from the merger of two lineages — transformed every Artemis learner into a witness, a participant, and a contributor to the world&rsquo;s most urgent challenges. From Minerva, it inherited the structural logic of sequential rotation: the city as curriculum, the absence of a campus, the insistence that place shapes understanding. From Darwin, it inherited the methodological logic of observational voyage: slow knowing before swift action, variation as insight, the journey itself as epistemology.

Minerva University proved that the campus could be dissolved into cities; Darwin proved that the classroom could be dissolved into the voyage.

                In 2014, Minerva University launched with a provocation: what if a university had no campus at all? Its students rotated through seven cities — San Francisco, Berlin, Buenos Aires, Seoul, Hyderabad, London, Taipei — living and learning in each for a semester. There were no lecture halls, no quad, no library building. The city was the campus. The world was the infrastructure.

              <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                Minerva proved that the campus was not a necessity but an inheritance — a legacy of medieval monasticism that had calcified into architectural assumption. Students who rotated through cities developed a kind of cultural fluency that no residential campus could provide. They learned to navigate difference, to adapt to unfamiliar systems, to see their own assumptions reflected in the mirror of other cultures. But Minerva&rsquo;s rotations were brief — a semester per city — and its students remained, in a sense, visitors. The Artemis Project asked: what would happen if the rotation were not a semester but years? What if learners were not visitors but witnesses?

              <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                In 1831, a 22-year-old naturalist boarded HMS Beagle and spent five years circumnavigating the globe. Charles Darwin did not discover evolution in a laboratory at Cambridge. He discovered it in the volcanic soils of the Galápagos, in the fossils of Patagonia, in the coral atolls of the Pacific. The voyage was not supplementary to his education — it was his education. The method of knowing was the journey itself.

              <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                But Darwin&rsquo;s voyage was solitary, unstructured, and privileged — the observations of a single man from a single empire. The Artemis Project asked another provocation: what if the voyage were collective, structured, and equitable? What if every learner&rsquo;s education included a voyage of comparable scope, but designed with the methodological rigour and ethical framework that Darwin&rsquo;s era lacked? What if the Beagle carried not one observer but hundreds, from every continent, and the voyage produced not just theory but tangible contributions to the communities it touched?

            <p>The World as Campus did not merely send students abroad — it dismantled the very concept of &ldquo;abroad,&rdquo; replacing it with a planet understood as a single, interconnected system of knowledge and challenge. By merging Minerva&rsquo;s structural insight — that the campus could be dissolved into cities — with Darwin&rsquo;s methodological insight — that the voyage could be a form of knowing — Artemis created something that neither lineage could have produced alone.</p>
          </div>

              <span><strong className="text-gray-900">The campus dissolved (2040–2055):</strong> By the 2040s, the notion that learning happened inside buildings had come to seem as quaint as the notion that the Earth was flat. The Voyage Rotation proved that the most transformative learning occurred at the intersection of difference — cultural, ecological, linguistic, economic. Campuses did not disappear; they became nodes in a global network rather than the centre of the educational universe, exactly as Minerva had first demonstrated at a smaller scale.</span>
            </li>
            <li className="flex gap-4">
              <span className="text-[#8A0000] font-bold mt-1 shrink-0">&#9632;</span>
              <span><strong className="text-gray-900">Sequential immersion institutionalised (2035–2065):</strong> Minerva&rsquo;s insight that each rotation city must build on the previous one became the governing logic of the Voyage Rotation. The Atlantic Awakening preceded the Indian Ocean Circuit because the history of forced migration demanded understanding before the study of voluntary trade routes. The sequence was not arbitrary — it was pedagogy, each leg a chapter in a cumulative education that no single location could provide.</span>
            </li>
            <li className="flex gap-4">
              <span className="text-[#8A0000] font-bold mt-1 shrink-0">&#9632;</span>
              <span><strong className="text-gray-900">The Rotation Protocol exported (2050–2080):</strong> Docking, Surveying, Specimen became the global standard for immersive learning. Over 200 universities on six continents adopted the protocol, adapting it to their own contexts while preserving its essential structure: observe before you act, partner before you lead, contribute before you leave. The protocol proved that Minerva&rsquo;s rotation logic and Darwin&rsquo;s observational discipline were not competitors but complements — structure without method was tourism, method without structure was wandering.</span>

              <span><strong className="text-gray-900">Community veto power (2035–present):</strong> The insistence that local partners hold veto authority over visiting projects was initially controversial — some faculty saw it as an infringement on academic freedom. Within a decade, it was universally recognised as the protocol&rsquo;s most important safeguard. It prevented the extractive research that had characterised Western academia&rsquo;s relationship with the Global South for centuries and ensured that the rotation was a partnership, not a passage.</span>

              <span><strong className="text-gray-900">The Voyage Convocation (2042–present):</strong> What began as an annual gathering of rotating learners became the world&rsquo;s most important interdisciplinary knowledge event — a place where a climate scientist from Svalbard, a governance scholar from Lagos, and a marine ecologist from Suva presented their Specimens side by side. The Convocation demonstrated that the most powerful ideas emerge not from silos but from the collision of perspectives that only a voyage can produce.</span>

              <span><strong className="text-gray-900">A new kind of graduate (2055–present):</strong> Artemis learners who completed the Voyage Rotation carried something no traditional graduate possessed: a planetary perspective grounded in both structure and method. They had seen the world&rsquo;s problems from multiple vantage points, understood that every solution is local before it is global, and possessed the humility that only sustained encounter with difference can teach. Employers, governments, and communities recognised them immediately — not by their credentials, but by their questions.</span>
