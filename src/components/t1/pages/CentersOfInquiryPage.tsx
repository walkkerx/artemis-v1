              <p className="font-bold italic text-sm text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
                The department was the atom of the university — the indivisible unit around which everything was organized. Faculty were hired, promoted, and protected by departments. Students were admitted, advised, and credentialed by departments. The entire architecture of higher education was departmental.
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                But the world&apos;s great challenges — climate change, pandemics, inequality, democratic erosion — did not respect departmental boundaries. They were inherently interdisciplinary, requiring integration of knowledge that no single department could provide. The gap between how problems existed in the world and how universities were organized to address them had become a chasm.

            <div className="space-y-4">

              <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                Artemis abolished departments entirely, replacing them with 15 Centers of Inquiry — interdisciplinary hubs organized around grand challenges rather than historical divisions of academic knowledge. Where departments created silos, Centers created bridges. Where departments trained students to think within walls, Centers trained them to think across landscapes.
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 leading-relaxed italic">
                &ldquo;The department was a container built for a world that no longer existed — a world where knowledge sat neatly in labeled boxes. But the most important questions had already escaped those boxes and were roaming free.&rdquo; — Dr. Lena Vasquez, 2028

                Every Center spans three global nodes — strategically chosen for cultural richness, challenge relevance, and community connection. A learner might begin in Valletta, deepen in Tokyo, and activate in San Francisco — all within a single Center of Inquiry. The distributed campus didn&apos;t just remove geographic barriers; it transformed them into opportunities for cultural immersion and local impact.

                With 15 Centers × 3 nodes each, Artemis maintains 45 physical locations worldwide — plus virtual environments, Synchrony Pods, and partner sites that extend the network to every inhabited continent.

              <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                Synchrony Pods enable truly immersive collaboration regardless of time zones or language barriers. Advanced telepresence creates the illusion of physical co-presence, haptic feedback allows manipulation of virtual objects together, and real-time translation AI eliminates language barriers entirely.
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                Beyond the Pods, a rich ecosystem of virtual learning environments — holographic design studios, simulated field sites, meditative reflection gardens, high-intensity crisis simulations — expanded what &ldquo;place&rdquo; could mean. At Artemis, place is defined by purpose, not geography.

              <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Constitutional design sprint completed. Working with 14 West African communities to develop governance frameworks that integrate traditional council structures with digital democracy tools. The key insight: technology should amplify existing decision-making traditions, not replace them. One community rejected our prototype entirely — they said their system had worked for 400 years and didn&apos;t need &lsquo;optimization.&rsquo; We listened. The result was better than anything we could have designed alone.</p>

A team of 3 Core Investigators and 8 Junior Fellows has achieved stable quantum coherence at room temperature using a protein scaffold derived from deep-ocean organisms. This changes everything — quantum computing is no longer confined to cryogenic labs. Three Centers have already requested access for parallel research. Sprint Cycle initiated.</p>

The most promising: a collaboration between Civilization Architecture and Planetary Systems on &lsquo;governance for climate refugees&apos; — a project that began as a Sprint Cycle and has now become a full Residency Cycle spanning 6 nodes. The boundaries between Centers are dissolving faster than we planned. This is good.</p>

Modular solar micro-grids deployed in 14 Atacama Desert communities now operating at 99.7% autonomy. The innovation: each unit is assembled and maintained by local technicians with 3 days of training. Open-source schematics have been downloaded 12,000 times. A Legacy Builder from the Circumpolar Return adapted the design for Antarctic research stations. Knowledge flows in every direction.</p>
